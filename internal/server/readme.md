### Flow of a Request
1. Request comes in
2. Security middleware processes it
3. If path starts with admin prefix → check auth
4. If matches static file → serve file
5. If matches API path → handle API request
6. Otherwise → forward to browser instance proxy

This code forms the core infrastructure that manages both the admin interface and routes traffic to the actual browser instances running in different "rooms". The actual room management and browser automation would be handled by other components (like the `ApiManager` and `proxyHandler`).
